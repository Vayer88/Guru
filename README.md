## Storyboarding and Ideation ##
Saeed led the conceptualization of the narrative for our team as he presented the idea to create a parody of a self-help ‘how-to’ video series. As a group, we found this interpretation of the prompt (Option 3) to be interesting and we began developing it collectively with Saeed leading the creative direction. 

The narrative itself is a how-to video which promotes a ‘guru’ who, supposedly, is able to teach his students how to transfer their consciousness into plants as a form of therapeutic meditation. Despite the comedic concept, the tone of the video initially follows that of typical self-help content. The absurdity of the narrative becomes increasingly apparent as we see him and one of his students gain this ability to momentarily turn into plants. Introducing these unrealistic elements in the narrative complements the sense of parody that we were aiming for in the conceptualization phase.

In terms of pre-production, Saeed produced an annotated storyboard that we used as a reference while shooting. This storyboard was detailed enough for us to understand the structure of the narrative and the content that needed to be shot while also allowing some room for adjustments to be made while shooting or editing. 

## Shot Types, Camerawork & Audio ##

Due to his experience with photography and videography, Redha was responsible for shooting the content for our video. The composition of most shots was planned with a standard use of wider establishing shots and medium-close ups during scenes in which a character is talking. Compositionally, most of these planned shots were conventional in following formal rules such as the rule of thirds and the consideration of headspace. With the exception of one wider shot, the majority of footage was captured using a 35-100mm which allowed us to focus on the subject while selectively incorporating environmental elements. 

However, some additional shots included a conscious use of increased negative space in order to emphasize the theme of nature throughout the series. This is seen in one of the establishing shots that introduce the guru and some of the shots featuring the unconscious student. Doing so also breaks the repetitive conventional framing and provides a unique visual identity to the work.

Additionally, we decided to incorporate some footage shot on iPhone to create a different perspective for the POV shots featured as the guru and the student ‘leave their bodies’. Doing so accentuates the aforementioned sense of absurdity that was intended from the conceptualization stage.

Tinh was responsible for recording the audio for our project. Diegetic dialogue was naturally recorded at the same time as the footage was shot to ensure everything was synced. There is also non-diegetic sound that was recorded on site (i.e interview with student) which creates a sense of immersion to the video. Conversely, narration was recorded afterwards as a means to string the narrative together and create a cohesive series. 

## Editing ##

Saeed and Tinh were in charge of post-production. utilized different types of cut like match cuts, jump cuts and J cuts. The variety of cuts makes the video more dynamic and avoids repetition. Moreover, the different cuts achieve different outcomes. For example, the match cuts create continuity while the jump cuts increase the pace of the video and make it more engaging. 
We also made use of color grading in order to make the color of the videos from the camera and phone footage match, thus creating a sense of cohesion. Moreover, to emphasize the element of absurdity, we incorporated dramatic sound effects and stock footage as a means to draw attention to the parody aspect of the video.

## Web Implementation ##

For Web Implementation, we needed to make a website that would look scammy in a sense. We used appealing imagery accompanies by elaborate descriptions to attract the potential customers and convince them to buy the service provided. Only after the signup and payment pages the user can see the content that is being sold, namely the three videos. it is a staged process, so videos are displayed in chronological order. In the end we have a credits page that allows the user to return to the main page if they wish to present the website to another person or rewatch the videos.
